## Current financial situation

At the moment of writing, we have received about $60k of donations.
Almost every person working on PauseAI is doing so voluntarily, so our burn rate is very low.
We can continue operating until Q2 2025 with our current burn rate.
All funding that we receive will be used to accelerate our growth and increase our impact.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No additional funding

- Hire an **organizing director**, who helps with growing our community and organizing volunteers. They will help us engage the community, organize events, reach out to politicians, and more.
- Organize our biggest protest yet during the November 2024 AI safety summit in France.
- Use our Google Ads grant ($10k/month) to reach more people.
- Set up a CRM system to manage our volunteers and outreach, and integrate this with our website and Discord server.
- Set up a newsletter/substack
- Grow our social media presence through regular posts and engagement.
- Create more video content (focused on shorts) to reach a wider audience.
- Improve our website (over 10 volunteers have directly contributed code so far)
- Get help from experts in various fields (marketing, policy, AI safety, community organizing, protesting, etc.) to learn from their experience and improve our work.
- Experiment with social media ads to grow our community and learn what works.
- Spend our remaining budget on PauseAI community projects through our MicroGrants program.
- Build alliances with other organizations and overlapping cause areas to amplify our impact.

### Scenario 2: 100k funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire a **social media director**. This will help us improve our presence on social media and reach more people.
- Increase our spending on Ads on various social media platforms.
- Increase our MicroGrants budget, allowing us to fund more community projects.

### Scenario 3: 200k to 500k funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire a **policy director** who will help us strategize and execute our policy goals. This person should help us educate volunteers on how to lobby effectively and help us with our policy proposals.
- Hire a **project director** who will help us organize our projects and campaigns. Our 100+ projects in the Discord server need more structure and guidance.
- Hire a **video creator** who specializes in making audiovisual content. They can help us professionalize our videos and reach a wider audience.
- Drastically increased ads & MicroGrants budgets, leading to more growth and impactful community projects.

### Scenario 4: 500k to 1M funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Finance local PauseAI chapters. Find talented and motivated individuals who can lead these. We already have [local communities](/communities) and [two legal entities](/legal) (US & UK) for local chapters.

### Scenario 5: 1M+ funding

- All of the above, plus:
- Hire a PR agency to set up a large-scale (international) media campaign.
